# %%RMX_APP_DISPLAY_NAME%% Agent Guide

This app was scaffolded with `remix new`. Use these conventions when continuing to build it out.

## Commands

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
npm run hmr
npm run start
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

## Building Features

Refer to ./.agents/skills/remix/SKILL.md. It owns the conventions for file placement, routes, controllers, middleware, data, auth, UI, and tests.

## Starter Layout

- `app/routes.ts` defines the shared route contract used by server and browser modules for type-safe hrefs
- `app/router.ts` wires routes to controllers and installs the standard Remix UI renderer used by actions
- Put top-level route actions in `app/actions/controller.tsx`; add `app/actions/<route-key>/controller.tsx` for nested route maps. `app/actions/controller.test.ts` is the root controller's router smoke test
- `app/actions/home-page.tsx` and `app/actions/document.tsx` render the route-owned starter UI
- `app/actions/public/` contains the browser runtime entry and interactive prompt button
- `app/assets.ts` owns the server-side asset pipeline used by the asset route and render middleware
- Root `public/` contains static files served unchanged from the app root

This starter intentionally begins small; add directories like `app/data/`, `app/middleware/`, `app/ui/`, and `test/` only when you need them.

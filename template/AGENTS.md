# %%RMX_APP_DISPLAY_NAME%% Agent Guide

This app was scaffolded with `remix new`. Use these conventions when continuing to build it out.

## Commands

```sh
npm i
npm run start
npm test
npm run typecheck
```

## Building Features

Refer to ./.agents/skills/remix/SKILL.md

## Starter Layout

- `app/actions/controller.tsx` owns the top-level route actions
- `app/routes.ts` defines the route contract
- `app/router.ts` wires routes to route handlers
- `app/ui/` holds the shared document and layout wrappers
- `app/actions/render.tsx` centralizes HTML response rendering for controllers
- `public/` contains static files served from the app root

## Route Ownership

- Start from `app/routes.ts` and map each route to the narrowest owner on disk.
- Put top-level route actions in `app/actions/controller.tsx`.
- Add `app/actions/<route-key>/controller.tsx` for nested route maps that need their own actions or middleware.
- Keep route-owned page modules next to the route that owns them.
- Move shared UI to `app/ui/`, not `app/actions/`.

## Build-Out Notes

- This starter intentionally begins small; add directories like `app/data/`, `app/middleware/`, and `test/` only when you need them.
- Prefer putting code in the narrowest owner before introducing shared modules.
- Avoid generic dumping-ground directories like `app/lib/` or `app/components/`.

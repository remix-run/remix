Added `reset()` method to all header utility classes, allowing instances to be updated in place from a string or object, or reset to empty values. This mirrors the constructor behavior on an existing instance, enabling stable object identity when header values change via standard `.set()`, `.append()`, and `.delete()` header methods.

Add animation prop, spring, and tween utilities

- `animate` prop on host elements enables enter, exit, and layout (FLIP) animations
- `spring()` function creates spring-based animation iterators with configurable stiffness, damping, and mass
- `tween()` function creates time-based animation iterators with customizable duration and easing (including `easings` presets)

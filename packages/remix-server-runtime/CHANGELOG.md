## 1.7.4

### Patch Changes

- Ignore pathless layout routes in action matches ([#4376](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/4376))

## 1.7.3

## 1.7.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix dependency conflicts with `type-fest` ([`87642b71b`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/commit/87642b71b20880707cf2d9168a113b9dca406ee8))

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Properly locked the dependency on `react-router-dom` to version 6.3.0 ([#4203](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/4203))

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- We've added a new type: `SerializeFrom`. This is used to infer the ([#4013](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/4013))
  JSON-serialized return type of loaders and actions.
- `MetaFunction` type can now infer `data` and `parentsData` types from route loaders ([#4022](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/4022))

### Patch Changes

- Improved performance for data serialization at runtime ([#3889](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/3889))

## 1.6.8

### Patch Changes

- We've added type safety for load context. `AppLoadContext` is now an an interface mapping `string` to `unknown`, allowing users to extend it via module augmentation: ([#1876](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/1876))

  ```ts
  declare module "@remix-run/server-runtime" {
    interface AppLoadContext {
      // add custom properties here!
    }
  }
  ```

## 1.6.5

### Patch Changes

- We enhanced the type signatures of `loader`/`action` and
  `useLoaderData`/`useActionData` to make it possible to infer the data type
  from return type of its related server function.

  To enable this feature, you will need to use the `LoaderArgs` type from your
  Remix runtime package instead of typing the function directly:

  ```diff
  - import type { LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/[runtime]";
  + import type { LoaderArgs } from "@remix-run/[runtime]";

  - export const loader: LoaderFunction = async (args) => {
  -   return json<LoaderData>(data);
  - }
  + export async function loader(args: LoaderArgs) {
  +   return json(data);
  + }
  ```

  Then you can infer the loader data by using `typeof loader` as the type
  variable in `useLoaderData`:

  ```diff
  - let data = useLoaderData() as LoaderData;
  + let data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>();
  ```

  The API above is exactly the same for your route `action` and `useActionData`
  via the `ActionArgs` type.

  With this change you no longer need to manually define a `LoaderData` type
  (huge time and typo saver!), and we serialize all values so that
  `useLoaderData` can't return types that are impossible over the network, such
  as `Date` objects or functions.

  See the discussions in [#1254](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/1254)
  and [#3276](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/pull/3276) for more context.

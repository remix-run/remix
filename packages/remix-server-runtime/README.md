# @remix-run/server-runtime

[Remix](https://remix.run) supports multiple server runtimes:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/how-workers-works/)
- [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/edge-functions/overview/)
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (Experimental ðŸ§ª)

Support for each runtime is provided by a corresponding Remix package:

- [`@remix-run/node`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/packages/remix-node)
- [`@remix-run/cloudflare`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/packages/remix-cloudflare)
- [`@netlify/remix-runtime`](https://github.com/netlify/remix-compute/tree/main/packages/remix-runtime)
- [`@remix-run/deno`](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/packages/remix-deno)

This package defines a "Remix server runtime interface" that each runtime package must conform to.

Each Remix server runtime package MUST:

- Implement and export values for each type in [`interface.ts`](./interface.ts)
- Re-export types in [`reexport.ts`](./reexport.ts)

Each Remix server runtime package MAY:

- Re-export the [default implementations](./index.ts) as its implementations
- Export custom implementations adhering to the [interface types](./interface.ts)
- Provide additional exports relevant for that runtime

# Deprecated

The `remix` package is no longer used for Remix modules. It was [officially deprecated in v1.6.0](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/v1.6.0) then finally [removed in v2.0.0](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/releases/tag/remix@2.0.0). This package should be removed from your project dependencies if you have it installed.

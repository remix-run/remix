/**
 * Don't try to add additional tests for <Scripts /> to this file!
 *
 * <Scripts /> gates most of its functionality on the **unexported**
 * variable isHydrated, defined inside ../components, and it sets that
 * variable the first time it is rendered. This means that subsequent
 * calls to <Scripts /> will skip writing actual script tags.
 *
 * Using jest.resetModules() or .isolateModules() won't help here as
 * we'd need to re-import or re-require [1]. Re-importing would need new
 * packages to work [2] and re-requiring has problems with React [3].

# fetch-proxy

`fetch-proxy` is an HTTP proxy for the [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

In the context of servers, an HTTP proxy server is a server that forwards all requests it receives to another server and returns the responses it receives. When you think about it this way, a [`fetch` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch) is like a mini proxy server sitting right there in your code. You send it requests, it goes and talks to some other server, and it gives you back the response it received.

`fetch-proxy` allows you to easily create `fetch` functions that act as proxies to "target" servers.

## Features

- Built on the standard [JavaScript Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
- Supports rewriting `Set-Cookie` headers received from target server
- Supports `X-Forwarded-Proto` and `X-Forwarded-Host` headers
- Supports custom `fetch` implementations

## Installation

Install from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
npm i @mjackson/fetch-proxy
```

## Usage

```ts
import { createFetchProxy } from '@mjackson/fetch-proxy';

// Create a proxy that sends all requests through to remix.run
let proxy = createFetchProxy('https://remix.run');

// This fetch handler is probably running as part of your server somewhere...
function handleFetch(request: Request): Promise<Response> {
  return proxy(request);
}

// Test it out by manually throwing a Request at it
let response = await handleFetch(new Request('https://shopify.com'));

let text = await response.text();
let title = text.match(/<title>([^<]+)<\/title>/)[1];
assert(title.includes('Remix'));
```

# Update the `remix` package by auto-generating from the `@remix-run/*` packages in the repo
# runs on any pushes/PRs to `main` that touch any `package.json` files since that would
# potentially alter the sub-exports that need to be reflected in the `remix` package.

  # via the $GITHUB_TOKEN will not re-run CI runs, but it will cancel ongoing CI runs
  # for the prior developer commit, which opens up the case for false positives on CI runs.
  # See: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/tutorials/authenticate-with-github_token#using-the-github_token-in-a-workflow

  # If we want to re-enable, we would just need to setup a PAT and use that instead of $GITHUB_TOKEN

# Experimental releases are handled a bit differently than standard releases.
# Experimental releases can be branched from anywhere as they are not intended
# for general use, and all packages will be versioned and published with the
# same hash for testing.
#
# This workflow will run when a GitHub release is created from experimental
# version tag. Unlike standard releases created via Changesets, only one tag
# should be created for all packages.
#
# To create a release:
# - Create a new branch for the release: git checkout -b `release-experimental`
#   - IMPORTANT: You should always create a new branch so that the version
#     changes don't accidentally get merged into `dev` or `main`. The branch
#     name must follow the convention of `release-experimental` or
#     `release-experimental-[feature]`.
# - Make whatever changes you need and commit them:
#   - `git add . && git commit "experimental changes!"`
# - Update version numbers and create a release tag:
#   - `pnpm run version:experimental`
# - Push to GitHub:
#   - `git push origin --follow-tags`
# - Create a new release for the tag on GitHub to trigger the CI workflow that
#   will publish the release to npm

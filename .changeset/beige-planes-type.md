We have been busy at work [Layering Remix on top of React Router 6.4](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/blob/main/decisions/0007-remix-on-react-router-6-4-0.md) and are excited to be releasing the step 1 in this process that consists of running the server flow through a local copy the new framework agnostic `@remix-run/router`.

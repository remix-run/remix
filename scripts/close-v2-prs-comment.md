Thank you for opening this pull request, and our apologies we haven't gotten around to it yet!

With the release of [React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7) we are sun-setting continued development/maintenance on Remix v2. If you have not already [upgraded to React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/remix), we recommend you do so. We've tried to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible with our [Future Flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/future-flags). We are now in the process of cleaning up outdated issues and pull requests to improve the overall hygiene of our repositories.

We plan to continue to address 2 types of issues in Remix v2:

- Bugs that pose security concerns
- Bugs that prevent upgrading to React Router v7

If you believe this pull request meets one of those criteria, please respond or create a new pull request so it pops up on our radar (since github notifications may get lost in the noise 😕).

For all other issues/changes, ongoing maintenance will be happening in React Router v7, so:

- If this is a bug fix, please reopen against [React Router v7](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
- If this is a new feature, please open a new [Proposal Discussion](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/new?category=proposals) in React Router, and if it gets enough community support it can be considered for implementation

If you have any questions you can always reach out on [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord). Thanks again for providing feedback and helping us make our framework even better!

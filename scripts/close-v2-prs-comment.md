Thank you for opening this pull request, and our apologies; we haven't gotten around to it yet!

With the release of [React Router v7](https://remix.run/blog/react-router-v7) we are sun-setting continued development/maintenance on Remix v2. If you have not already [upgraded to React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/upgrading/remix), we recommend you do so. We've tried to make the upgrade process as smooth as possible with our [Future Flags](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/future-flags). We are now in the process of cleaning up outdated issues and pull requests to improve the overall hygiene of our repositories.

We plan to continue to address two types of issues in Remix v2:

- Bugs that pose security concerns
- Bugs that prevent upgrading to React Router v7

If you believe this pull request meets one of those criteria, please respond or create a new pull request so it pops up on our radar (since GitHub notifications may get lost in the noise ðŸ˜•).

For all other issues/changes, ongoing maintenance will be happening in React Router v7, so:

- If this is a bug fix, please reopen against [React Router v7](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
- If this is a new feature, please open a new [Proposal Discussion](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/discussions/new?category=proposals) in React Router, and if it gets enough community support, it can be considered for implementation

If you have any questions, you can always reach out on [Discord](https://rmx.as/discord). Thanks again for providing feedback and helping us make our framework even better!

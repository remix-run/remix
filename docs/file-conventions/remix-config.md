# remix.config.js

This file has a few build and development configuration options, but does not actually run on your server.

```tsx filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  appDirectory: "app",
  assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
  ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
  publicPath: "/build/",
  routes(defineRoutes) {
    return defineRoutes((route) => {
      route("/somewhere/cool/*", "catchall.tsx");
    });
  },
  serverBuildPath: "build/index.js",
  serverBuildTarget: "node-cjs",
};
```

## appDirectory

The path to the `app` directory, relative to remix.config.js. Defaults to
`"app"`.

```js
// default
exports.appDirectory = "./app";

// custom
exports.appDirectory = "./elsewhere";
```

## assetsBuildDirectory

The path to the browser build, relative to remix.config.js. Defaults to
"public/build". Should be deployed to static hosting.

## cacheDirectory

The path to a directory Remix can use for caching things in development,
relative to `remix.config.js`. Defaults to `".cache"`.

## devServerBroadcastDelay

The delay, in milliseconds, before the dev server broadcasts a reload event.
There is no delay by default.

## devServerPort

The port number to use for the dev websocket server. Defaults to 8002.

## ignoredRouteFiles

This is an array of globs (via [minimatch][minimatch]) that Remix will match to
files while reading your `app/routes` directory. If a file matches, it will be
ignored rather than treated like a route module. This is useful for ignoring
dotfiles (like `.DS_Store` files) or CSS/test files you wish to colocate.

## publicPath

The URL prefix of the browser build with a trailing slash. Defaults to
`"/build/"`. This is the path the browser will use to find assets.

## routes

A function for defining custom routes, in addition to those already defined
using the filesystem convention in `app/routes`. Both sets of routes will be merged.

```tsx
exports.routes = async (defineRoutes) => {
  // If you need to do async work, do it before calling `defineRoutes`, we use
  // the call stack of `route` inside to set nesting.

  return defineRoutes((route) => {
    // A common use for this is catchall routes.
    // - The first argument is the React Router path to match against
    // - The second is the relative filename of the route handler
    route("/some/path/*", "catchall.tsx");

    // if you want to nest routes, use the optional callback argument
    route("some/:path", "some/route/file.js", () => {
      // - path is relative to parent path
      // - filenames are still relative to the app directory
      route("relative/path", "some/other/file");
    });
  });
};
```

## server

A server entrypoint, relative to the root directory that becomes your server's
main module. If specified, Remix will compile this file along with your
application into a single file to be deployed to your server. This file can use
either a `.js` or `.ts` file extension.

## serverBuildDirectory

<docs-warning>This option is deprecated and will likely be removed in a future
stable release. Use [`serverBuildPath`][server-build-path] instead.</docs-warning>

The path to the server build, relative to `remix.config.js`. Defaults to
"build". This needs to be deployed to your server.

## serverBuildPath

The path to the server build file, relative to `remix.config.js`. This file
should end in a `.js` extension and should be deployed to your server.

If omitted, the default build path will be based on your
[`serverBuildTarget`][server-build-target].

## serverBuildTarget

The target of the server build. Defaults to `"node-cjs"`.

The `serverBuildTarget` can be one of the following:

- [`"arc"`][arc]
- [`"cloudflare-pages"`][cloudflare-pages]
- [`"cloudflare-workers"`][cloudflare-workers]
- [`"deno"`][deno]
- [`"netlify"`][netlify]
- [`"node-cjs"`][node-cjs]
- [`"vercel"`][vercel]

## serverDependenciesToBundle

A list of regex patterns that determines if a module is transpiled and included in the server bundle. This can be useful when consuming ESM only packages in a CJS build, or when consuming packages with [CSS side-effect imports][css-side-effect-imports].

For example, the `unified` ecosystem is all ESM-only. Let's also say we're using a `@sindresorhus/slugify` which is ESM-only as well. Here's how you would be able to consume those packages in a CJS app without having to use dynamic imports:

```ts filename=remix.config.js lines=[8-13]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  appDirectory: "app",
  assetsBuildDirectory: "public/build",
  publicPath: "/build/",
  serverBuildDirectory: "build",
  ignoredRouteFiles: ["**/.*"],
  serverDependenciesToBundle: [
    /^rehype.*/,
    /^remark.*/,
    /^unified.*/,
    "@sindresorhus/slugify",
  ],
};
```

## watchPaths

An array, string, or async function that defines custom directories, relative to the project root, to watch while running [remix dev][remix-dev]. These directories are in addition to [`appDirectory`][app-directory].

```tsx
exports.watchPaths = async () => {
  return ["./some/path/*"];
};

// also valid
exports.watchPaths = ["./some/path/*"];
```

## File Name Conventions

There are a few conventions that Remix uses you should be aware of.

<docs-info>[Dilum Sanjaya][dilum-sanjaya] made [an awesome visualization][an-awesome-visualization] of how routes in the file system map to the URL in your app that might help you understand these conventions.</docs-info>

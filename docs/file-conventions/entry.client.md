# entry.client

By default, Remix will handle hydrating your app on the client for you. If you want to customize this behavior, you can run `npx remix reveal` to generate a `app/entry.client.tsx` (or `.jsx`) that will take precedence. This file is the entry point for the browser and is responsible for hydrating the markup generated by the server in your [server entry module][server_entry_module]; however, you can also initialize any other client-side code here.

Typically, this module uses `ReactDOM.hydrateRoot` to hydrate the markup already generated on the server in your [server entry module][server_entry_module].

Here's a basic example:

```tsx filename=app/entry.client.tsx
import { RemixBrowser } from "@remix-run/react";
import { startTransition, StrictMode } from "react";
import { hydrateRoot } from "react-dom/client";

startTransition(() => {
  hydrateRoot(
    document,
    <StrictMode>
      <RemixBrowser />
    </StrictMode>
  );
});
```

This is the first piece of code that runs in the browser. You can initialize client side libraries, add client-only providers, etc.

[server_entry_module]: ./entry.server

# `handle`

Exporting a handle allows you to create application conventions with the [`useMatches`][use-matches] hook. You can put whatever values you want on it:

```tsx
export const handle = {
  its: "all yours",
};
```

This is almost always used in conjunction with `useMatches`. To see what kinds of things you can do with it, refer to [`useMatches`][use-matches] for more information.

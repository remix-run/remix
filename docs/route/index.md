# Route Modules

A route in Remix can be used for many things. Usually theyâ€™re used for the user interface of your app, like a React component with server-side lifecycle hooks. But they can also serve as generic routes for any kind of resource (like dynamic CSS or social images).

It's important to read [Route Module Constraints][route-module-constraints].

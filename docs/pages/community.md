# Community

The Remix community is large and growing rapidly. We're excited you're a part of it. We try hard to keep it a friendly place where people want to hang out and help/be helped. We're all here just trying to build websites and make the web better.

To that end, please keep in mind [our code of conduct][our-code-of-conduct].

## Support

### Discord

The [Remix Discord server][remix-discord-server] is a great place to have conversations, answer and ask questions, all about Remix.

### GitHub Discussions

Our [GitHub discussions forum][git-hub-discussions-forum] is a good place to chat about ideas and approaches you can take with Remix.

## Examples

You can find (and create) examples in the [Remix examples repository][the-examples-repository].

## Community Adapters

You can find Community Adapters in the [Adapters][community-adapters] section of the documentation.

If you've written your own adapter, and think it will be valuable for others, you can [update this list on GitHub][community-adapters-github].

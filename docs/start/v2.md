# Upgrading to v2

<docs-warning>This documentation provides guidance on migrating from v1 to v2 while using the [Classic Remix compiler][classic-remix-compiler]. For additional guidance on migrating to Vite, refer to the [Remix Vite documentation][remix-vite].</docs-warning>

All v2 APIs and behaviors are available in v1 with [Future Flags][future-flags]. They can be enabled one at a time to avoid development disruption of your project. After you have enabled all flags, upgrading to v2 should be a non-breaking upgrade.

If you're having trouble see the [Troubleshooting][troubleshooting] section.

For a quick walkthrough of some common upgrade issues checkout [🎥 2 minutes to v2][2-min-to-v2].

## `remix dev`

For configuration options, see the [`remix dev` docs][dev-docs].

### `remix-serve`

If you are using the Remix App Server (`remix-serve`), enable `v2_dev`:

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  future: {
    v2_dev: true,
  },
};
```

That's it!

### Custom app server

If you are using your own app server (`server.js`),
then check out our [templates][templates] for examples of how to integrate with `v2_dev`
or follow these steps:

1. Enable `v2_dev`:

   ```js filename=remix.config.js
   /** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
   module.exports = {
     future: {
       v2_dev: true,
     },
   };
   ```

2. Update `scripts` in `package.json`:

   - Replace any `remix watch` with `remix dev`
   - Remove redundant `NODE_ENV=development`
   - Use `-c` / `--command` to run your app server

   For example:

   ```diff filename=package.json
    {
      "scripts": {
   -    "dev:remix": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development remix watch",
   -    "dev:server": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development node ./server.js"
   +    "dev": "remix dev -c 'node ./server.js'",
      }
    }
   ```

3. Send a "ready" message to the Remix compiler once your app is running

   ```ts filename=server.js lines=[1-2,11]
   import { broadcastDevReady } from "@remix-run/node";
   // import { logDevReady } from "@remix-run/cloudflare" // use `logDevReady` if using CloudFlare

   const BUILD_DIR = path.join(process.cwd(), "build");

   // ... code setting up your server goes here ...

   const port = 3000;
   app.listen(port, async () => {
     console.log(`👉 http://localhost:${port}`);
     broadcastDevReady(await import(BUILD_DIR));
   });
   ```

4. (Optional) `--manual`

   If you were relying on `require` cache purging, you can keep doing so by using the `--manual` flag:

   ```shellscript nonumber
   remix dev --manual -c 'node ./server.js'
   ```

   Check out the [manual mode guide][manual-mode] for more details.

### After upgrading from v1 to v2

After you've enabled the `future.v2_dev` flag in v1 and gotten that working, you're ready to upgrade to v2.
If you just had `v2_dev` set to `true`, you can remove it and things should work.

If you are using `v2_dev` config, you'll need to move it to the `dev` config field:

```diff filename=remix.config.js
  /** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
  module.exports = {
-   future: {
-     v2_dev: {
-       port: 4004
-     }
-   }
+   dev: {
+     port: 4004
+   }
  }
```

## File System Route Convention

#### Upgrading without changing files

You can keep using the old convention with `@remix-run/v1-route-convention` even after upgrading to v2 if you don't want to make the change right now (or ever, it's just a convention, and you can use whatever file organization you prefer).

```shellscript nonumber
npm i -D @remix-run/v1-route-convention
```

```js filename=remix.config.js
const {
  createRoutesFromFolders,
} = require("@remix-run/v1-route-convention");

/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  future: {
    // makes the warning go away in v1.15+
    v2_routeConvention: true,
  },

  routes(defineRoutes) {
    // uses the v1 convention, works in v1.15+ and v2
    return createRoutesFromFolders(defineRoutes);
  },
};
```

#### Upgrading to the new convention

- Route nesting is now created by dots (`.`) in file names instead of folder nesting
- `suffixed_` underscores in segments opt-out of nesting with a potentially matching parent route instead of dots (`.`).
- `_prefixed` underscores in segments create layout routes without a path instead of a `__double` underscore prefix.
- `_index.tsx` files create index routes instead of `index.tsx`

A routes folder that looks like this in v1:

```text bad
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── __auth/
│   │   ├── login.tsx
│   │   ├── logout.tsx
│   │   └── signup.tsx
│   ├── __public/
│   │   ├── about-us.tsx
│   │   ├── contact.tsx
│   │   └── index.tsx
│   ├── dashboard/
│   │   ├── calendar/
│   │   │   ├── $day.tsx
│   │   │   └── index.tsx
│   │   ├── projects/
│   │   │   ├── $projectId/
│   │   │   │   ├── collaborators.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── edit.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   │   │   ├── settings.tsx
│   │   │   │   └── tasks.$taskId.tsx
│   │   │   ├── $projectId.tsx
│   │   │   └── new.tsx
│   │   ├── calendar.tsx
│   │   ├── index.tsx
│   │   └── projects.tsx
│   ├── __auth.tsx
│   ├── __public.tsx
│   └── dashboard.projects.$projectId.print.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

Becomes this with `v2_routeConvention`:

```text good
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _auth.login.tsx
│   ├── _auth.logout.tsx
│   ├── _auth.signup.tsx
│   ├── _auth.tsx
│   ├── _public._index.tsx
│   ├── _public.about-us.tsx
│   ├── _public.contact.tsx
│   ├── _public.tsx
│   ├── dashboard._index.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.calendar._index.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.calendar.$day.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.calendar.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId._index.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId.collaborators.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId.edit.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId.settings.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId.tasks.$taskId.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.$projectId.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.new.tsx
│   ├── dashboard.projects.tsx
│   └── dashboard_.projects.$projectId.print.tsx
└── root.tsx
```

Note that parent routes are now grouped together instead of having dozens of routes between them (like the auth routes). Routes with the same path but not the same nesting (like `dashboard` and `dashboard_`) also group together.

With the new convention, any route can be a directory with a `route.tsx` file inside to define the route module. This enables co-location of modules with the route they're used in:

For example, we can move `_public.tsx` to `_public/route.tsx` and then co-locate modules the route uses:

```text
app/
├── routes/
│   ├── _auth.tsx
│   ├── _public/
│   │   ├── footer.tsx
│   │   ├── header.tsx
│   │   └── route.tsx
│   ├── _public._index.tsx
│   ├── _public.about-us.tsx
│   └── etc.
└── root.tsx
```

For more background on this change, see the [original "flat routes" proposal][flat-routes].

## Route `headers`

In Remix v2, the behavior for route `headers` functions has changed slightly. You can opt-into this new behavior ahead of time via the `future.v2_headers` flag in `remix.config.js`.

In v1, Remix would only use the result of the leaf "rendered" route `headers` function. It was your responsibility to add a `headers` function to every potential leaf and merge in `parentHeaders` accordingly. This can get tedious quickly and is also easy to forget to add a `headers` function when you add a new route, even if you want it to just share the same headers from its parent.

In v2, Remix now uses the deepest `headers` function that it finds in the rendered routes. This more easily allows you to share headers across routes from a common ancestor. Then as needed you can add `headers` functions to deeper routes if they require specific behavior.

## Route `meta`

In Remix v2, the signature for route `meta` functions and how Remix handles meta tags under the hood have changed.

Instead of returning an object from `meta`, you will now return an array of descriptors and manage the merge yourself. This brings the `meta` API closer to `links`, and it allows for more flexibility and control over how meta tags are rendered.

In addition, `<Meta />` will no longer render meta for every route in the hierarchy. Only data returned from `meta` in the leaf route will be rendered. You can still choose to include meta from the parent route by accessing [`matches` in the function's arguments][meta-v2-matches].

For more background on this change, see the [original v2 `meta` proposal][meta-v2-rfc].

#### Using v1 `meta` conventions in v2

You can update your `meta` exports with the `@remix-run/v1-meta` package to continue using v1 conventions.

Using the `metaV1` function, you can pass in the `meta` function's arguments and the same object it currently returns. This function will use the same merging logic to merge the leaf route's meta with its **direct parent route** meta before converting it to an array of meta descriptors usable in v2.

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
export function meta() {
  return {
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    "og:title": "...",
  };
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
import { metaV1 } from "@remix-run/v1-meta";

export function meta(args) {
  return metaV1(args, {
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    "og:title": "...",
  });
}
```

It's important to note that this function will _not_ merge meta across the entire hierarchy by default. This is because you may have some routes that return an array of objects directly without the `metaV1` function and this could result in unpredictable behavior. If you want to merge meta across the entire hierarchy, use the `metaV1` function for all of your route's meta exports.

#### The `parentsData` argument

In v2, the `meta` function no longer receives the `parentsData` argument. This is because `meta` now has access to all of your route matches via the [`matches` argument][meta-v2-matches], which includes loader data for each match.

To replicate the API of `parentsData`, the `@remix-run/v1-meta` package provides a `getMatchesData` function. It returns an object where the data for each match is keyed by the route's ID.

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
export function meta(args) {
  const parentData = args.parentsData["routes/parent"];
}
```

Becomes:

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
import { getMatchesData } from "@remix-run/v1-meta";

export function meta(args) {
  const matchesData = getMatchesData(args);
  const parentData = matchesData["routes/parent"];
}
```

#### Updating to the new `meta`

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
export function meta() {
  return {
    title: "...",
    description: "...",
    "og:title": "...",
  };
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
export function meta() {
  return [
    { title: "..." },
    { name: "description", content: "..." },
    { property: "og:title", content: "..." },

    // you can now add SEO related <links>
    { tagName: "link", rel: "canonical", href: "..." },

    // and <script type=ld+json>
    {
      "script:ld+json": {
        some: "value",
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

#### The `matches` argument

Note that in v1 the objects returned from nested routes were all merged, you will need to manage the merge yourself now with `matches`:

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
export function meta({ matches }) {
  const rootMeta = matches[0].meta;
  const title = rootMeta.find((m) => m.title);

  return [
    title,
    { name: "description", content: "..." },
    { property: "og:title", content: "..." },

    // you can now add SEO related <links>
    { tagName: "link", rel: "canonical", href: "..." },

    // and <script type=ld+json>
    {
      "script:ld+json": {
        "@context": "https://schema.org",
        "@type": "Organization",
        name: "Remix",
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

The [meta][meta] docs have more tips on merging route meta.

## `CatchBoundary` and `ErrorBoundary`

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  future: {
    v2_errorBoundary: true,
  },
};
```

In v1, a thrown `Response` rendered the closest `CatchBoundary` while all other unhandled exceptions rendered the `ErrorBoundary`. In v2 there is no `CatchBoundary` and all unhandled exceptions will render the `ErrorBoundary`, response or otherwise.

Additionally, the error is no longer passed to `ErrorBoundary` as props but is accessed with the `useRouteError` hook.

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
import { useCatch } from "@remix-run/react";

export function CatchBoundary() {
  const caught = useCatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Oops</h1>
      <p>Status: {caught.status}</p>
      <p>{caught.data.message}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export function ErrorBoundary({ error }) {
  console.error(error);
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Uh oh ...</h1>
      <p>Something went wrong</p>
      <pre>{error.message || "Unknown error"}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Becomes:

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
import {
  useRouteError,
  isRouteErrorResponse,
} from "@remix-run/react";

export function ErrorBoundary() {
  const error = useRouteError();

  // when true, this is what used to go to `CatchBoundary`
  if (isRouteErrorResponse(error)) {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Oops</h1>
        <p>Status: {error.status}</p>
        <p>{error.data.message}</p>
      </div>
    );
  }

  // Don't forget to typecheck with your own logic.
  // Any value can be thrown, not just errors!
  let errorMessage = "Unknown error";
  if (isDefinitelyAnError(error)) {
    errorMessage = error.message;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Uh oh ...</h1>
      <p>Something went wrong.</p>
      <pre>{errorMessage}</pre>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## `formMethod`

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  future: {
    v2_normalizeFormMethod: true,
  },
};
```

Multiple APIs return the `formMethod` of a submission. In v1 they returned a lowercase version of the method but in v2 they return the UPPERCASE version. This is to bring it in line with HTTP and `fetch` specifications.

```tsx
function Something() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  // v1
  navigation.formMethod === "post";

  // v2
  navigation.formMethod === "POST";
}

export function shouldRevalidate({ formMethod }) {
  // v1
  formMethod === "post";

  // v2
  formMethod === "POST";
}
```

## `useTransition`

This hook is now called `useNavigation` to avoid confusion with the recent React hook by the same name. It also no longer has the `type` field and flattens the `submission` object into the `navigation` object itself.

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
import { useTransition } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const transition = useTransition();
  transition.submission.formData;
  transition.submission.formMethod;
  transition.submission.formAction;
  transition.type;
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
import { useNavigation } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  // transition.submission keys are flattened onto `navigation[key]`
  navigation.formData;
  navigation.formMethod;
  navigation.formAction;

  // this key is removed
  navigation.type;
}
```

You can derive the previous `transition.type` with the following examples. Keep in mind, there's probably a simpler way to get the same behavior, usually checking `navigation.state`, `navigation.formData` or the data returned from an action with `useActionData` can get the UX you're looking for. Feel free to ask us in Discord, and we'll help you out :D

```tsx
function Component() {
  const navigation = useNavigation();

  // transition.type === "actionSubmission"
  const isActionSubmission =
    navigation.state === "submitting";

  // transition.type === "actionReload"
  const isActionReload =
    navigation.state === "loading" &&
    navigation.formMethod != null &&
    navigation.formMethod != "GET" &&
    // We had a submission navigation and are loading the submitted location
    navigation.formAction === navigation.location.pathname;

  // transition.type === "actionRedirect"
  const isActionRedirect =
    navigation.state === "loading" &&
    navigation.formMethod != null &&
    navigation.formMethod != "GET" &&
    // We had a submission navigation and are now navigating to different location
    navigation.formAction !== navigation.location.pathname;

  // transition.type === "loaderSubmission"
  const isLoaderSubmission =
    navigation.state === "loading" &&
    navigation.state.formMethod === "GET" &&
    // We had a loader submission and are navigating to the submitted location
    navigation.formAction === navigation.location.pathname;

  // transition.type === "loaderSubmissionRedirect"
  const isLoaderSubmissionRedirect =
    navigation.state === "loading" &&
    navigation.state.formMethod === "GET" &&
    // We had a loader submission and are navigating to a new location
    navigation.formAction !== navigation.location.pathname;
}
```

**A note on GET submissions**

In Remix v1, GET submissions such as `<Form method="get">` or `submit({}, { method: 'get' })` went from `idle -> submitting -> idle` in `transition.state`. This is not quite semantically correct since even though you're "submitting" a form, you're performing a GET navigation and only executing loaders (not actions). Functionally, it's no different from a `<Link>` or `navigate()` except that the user may be specifying the search param values via inputs.

In v2, GET submissions are more accurately reflected as loading navigations and thus go `idle -> loading -> idle` to align `navigation.state` with the behavior of normal links. If your GET submission came from a `<Form>` or `submit()`, then `useNavigation.form*` will be populated, so you can differentiate if needed.

## `useFetcher`

Like `useNavigation`, `useFetcher` has flattened the `submission` and removed the `type` field.

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
import { useFetcher } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();
  fetcher.submission.formData;
  fetcher.submission.formMethod;
  fetcher.submission.formAction;
  fetcher.type;
}
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
import { useFetcher } from "@remix-run/react";

function SomeComponent() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  // these keys are flattened
  fetcher.formData;
  fetcher.formMethod;
  fetcher.formAction;

  // this key is removed
  fetcher.type;
}
```

You can derive the previous `fetcher.type` with the following examples. Keep in mind, there's probably a simpler way to get the same behavior, usually checking `fetcher.state`, `fetcher.formData` or the data returned from an action on `fetcher.data` can get the UX you're looking for. Feel free to ask us in Discord, and we'll help you out :D

```tsx
function Component() {
  const fetcher = useFetcher();

  // fetcher.type === "init"
  const isInit =
    fetcher.state === "idle" && fetcher.data == null;

  // fetcher.type === "done"
  const isDone =
    fetcher.state === "idle" && fetcher.data != null;

  // fetcher.type === "actionSubmission"
  const isActionSubmission = fetcher.state === "submitting";

  // fetcher.type === "actionReload"
  const isActionReload =
    fetcher.state === "loading" &&
    fetcher.formMethod != null &&
    fetcher.formMethod != "GET" &&
    // If we returned data, we must be reloading
    fetcher.data != null;

  // fetcher.type === "actionRedirect"
  const isActionRedirect =
    fetcher.state === "loading" &&
    fetcher.formMethod != null &&
    fetcher.formMethod != "GET" &&
    // If we have no data we must have redirected
    fetcher.data == null;

  // fetcher.type === "loaderSubmission"
  const isLoaderSubmission =
    fetcher.state === "loading" &&
    fetcher.formMethod === "GET";

  // fetcher.type === "normalLoad"
  const isNormalLoad =
    fetcher.state === "loading" &&
    fetcher.formMethod == null;
}
```

**A note on GET submissions**

In Remix v1, GET submissions such as `<fetcher.Form method="get">` or `fetcher.submit({}, { method: 'get' })` went from `idle -> submitting -> idle` in `fetcher.state`. This is not quite semantically correct since even though you're "submitting" a form, you're performing a GET request and only executing a loader (not an action). Functionally, it's no different from a `fetcher.load()` except that the user may be specifying the search param values via inputs.

In v2, GET submissions are more accurately reflected as loading requests and thus go `idle -> loading -> idle` to align `fetcher.state` with the behavior of normal fetcher loads. If your GET submission came from a `<fetcher.Form>` or `fetcher.submit()`, then `fetcher.form*` will be populated, so you can differentiate if needed.

## Links `imagesizes` and `imagesrcset`

Route `links` properties should all be the React camelCase values instead of HTML lowercase values. These two values snuck in as lowercase in v1. In v2 only the camelCase versions are valid:

```tsx bad filename=app/routes/v1-route.tsx
export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "preload",
      as: "image",
      imagesrcset: "...",
      imagesizes: "...",
    },
  ];
};
```

```tsx filename=app/routes/v2-route.tsx good
export const links: V2_LinksFunction = () => {
  return [
    {
      rel: "preload",
      as: "image",
      imageSrcSet: "...",
      imageSizes: "...",
    },
  ];
};
```

## `browserBuildDirectory`

In your `remix.config.js`, rename `browserBuildDirectory` to `assetsBuildDirectory`.

```js bad filename=remix.config.js lines=[3]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  browserBuildDirectory: "./public/build",
};
```

```js filename=remix.config.js good lines=[3]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  assetsBuildDirectory: "./public/build",
};
```

## `devServerBroadcastDelay`

Remove `devServerBroadcastDelay` from your `remix.config.js` as the race conditions that necessitated this option have
been eliminated in v2 or with `v2_dev`.

```diff filename=remix.config.js
  /** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
  module.exports = {
-   devServerBroadcastDelay: 300,
  };
```

## `devServerPort`

In your `remix.config.js`, rename `devServerPort` to `future.v2_dev.port`.

```js bad filename=remix.config.js lines=[3]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  devServerPort: 8002,
};
```

```js filename=remix.config.js good lines=[3-7]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  // While on v1.x, this is via a future flag
  future: {
    v2_dev: {
      port: 8002,
    },
  },
};
```

Once you upgrade from v1 to v2, this flattens to a [root-level `dev` config][dev-after-upgrading].

## `serverBuildDirectory`

In your `remix.config.js`, rename `serverBuildDirectory` to `serverBuildPath` and specify a module path, not a directory.

```js bad filename=remix.config.js lines=[3]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  serverBuildDirectory: "./build",
};
```

```js filename=remix.config.js good lines=[3]
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  serverBuildPath: "./build/index.js",
};
```

Remix used to create more than a single module for the server, but it now creates a single file.

## `serverBuildTarget`

Instead of specifying a build target, use the [`remix.config.js`][remix_config] options to generate the server build your server target expects. This change allows Remix to deploy to more JavaScript runtimes, servers, and hosts without Remix source code needing to know about them.

The following configurations should replace your current `serverBuildTarget`:

#### `arc`

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  publicPath: "/_static/build/",
  serverBuildPath: "server/index.js",
  serverMainFields: ["main", "module"], // default value, can be removed

  serverPlatform: "node", // default value, can be removed
};
```

## `serverModuleFormat`

The default server module output format has changed from `cjs` to `esm`. You can continue to use CJS in v2, many dependencies in your app might not be compatible with ESM.

In your `remix.config.js`, you should specify either `serverModuleFormat: "cjs"` to retain existing behavior, or `serverModuleFormat: "esm"`, to opt into the new behavior.

## `browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill`

Polyfills for Node.js built-in modules are no longer provided by default for the browser. In Remix v2 you'll need to explicitly reintroduce any polyfills (or blank polyfills) as required:

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: {
      buffer: true,
      fs: "empty",
    },
    globals: {
      Buffer: true,
    },
  },
};
```

Even though we recommend being explicit about which polyfills are allowed in your browser bundle, especially since some polyfills can be quite large, you can quickly reinstate the full set of polyfills from Remix v1 with the following configuration:

```js filename=remix.config.js
const { builtinModules } = require("node:module");

/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  browserNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: builtinModules,
  },
};
```

## `serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill`

Polyfills for Node.js built-in modules are no longer be provided by default for non-Node.js server platforms.

If you are targeting a non-Node.js server platform and want to opt into the new default behavior in v1, in `remix.config.js` you should first remove all server polyfills by explicitly providing an empty object for `serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill.modules`:

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: {},
  },
};
```

You can then reintroduce any polyfills (or blank polyfills) as required.

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: {
      buffer: true,
      fs: "empty",
    },
    globals: {
      Buffer: true,
    },
  },
};
```

For reference, the complete set of default polyfills from v1 can be manually specified as follows:

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  serverNodeBuiltinsPolyfill: {
    modules: {
      _stream_duplex: true,
      _stream_passthrough: true,
      _stream_readable: true,
      _stream_transform: true,
      _stream_writable: true,
      assert: true,
      "assert/strict": true,
      buffer: true,
      console: true,
      constants: true,
      crypto: "empty",
      diagnostics_channel: true,
      domain: true,
      events: true,
      fs: "empty",
      "fs/promises": "empty",
      http: true,
      https: true,
      module: true,
      os: true,
      path: true,
      "path/posix": true,
      "path/win32": true,
      perf_hooks: true,
      process: true,
      punycode: true,
      querystring: true,
      stream: true,
      "stream/promises": true,
      "stream/web": true,
      string_decoder: true,
      sys: true,
      timers: true,
      "timers/promises": true,
      tty: true,
      url: true,
      util: true,
      "util/types": true,
      vm: true,
      wasi: true,
      worker_threads: true,
      zlib: true,
    },
  },
};
```

## `installGlobals`

For preparation of using Node's built in fetch implementation, installing the fetch globals is now a responsibility of the app server. If you are using `remix-serve`, nothing is required. If you are using your own app server, you will need to install the globals yourself.

```ts filename=server.ts
import { installGlobals } from "@remix-run/node";

installGlobals();
```

### Removal of exported polyfills

Remix v2 also no longer exports these polyfilled implementations from `@remix-run/node`, and instead you should just use the instances in the global namespace. One place this is likely to surface and require a change is your `app/entry.server.tsx` file, where you'll also need to convert the Node [`PassThrough`][pass_through_class] into a web [`ReadableStream`][readable_stream] via `createReadableStreamFromReadable`:

```diff filename=app/entry.server.tsx
  import { PassThrough } from "node:stream";
  import type { AppLoadContext, EntryContext } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
- import { Response } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
+ import { createReadableStreamFromReadable } from "@remix-run/node"; // or cloudflare/deno
  import { RemixServer } from "@remix-run/react";
  import { isbot } from "isbot";
  import { renderToPipeableStream } from "react-dom/server";

  const ABORT_DELAY = 5_000;

  export default function handleRequest({ /* ... */ }) { ... }

  function handleBotRequest(...) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let shellRendered = false;
      const { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(
        <RemixServer ... />,
        {
          onAllReady() {
            shellRendered = true;
            const body = new PassThrough();

            responseHeaders.set("Content-Type", "text/html");

            resolve(
-             new Response(body, {
+             new Response(createReadableStreamFromReadable(body), {
                headers: responseHeaders,
                status: responseStatusCode,
              })
            );

            pipe(body);
          },
          ...
          onShellError(error: unknown) { ... }
          onError(error: unknown) { ... }
        }
      );

      setTimeout(abort, ABORT_DELAY);
    });
  }

  function handleBrowserRequest(...) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      let shellRendered = false;
      const { pipe, abort } = renderToPipeableStream(
        <RemixServer ... />,
        {
          onShellReady() {
            shellRendered = true;
            const body = new PassThrough();

            responseHeaders.set("Content-Type", "text/html");

            resolve(
-              new Response(body, {
+              new Response(createReadableStreamFromReadable(body), {
                headers: responseHeaders,
                status: responseStatusCode,
              })
            );

            pipe(body);
          },
          onShellError(error: unknown) { ... },
          onError(error: unknown) { ... },
        }
      );

      setTimeout(abort, ABORT_DELAY);
    });
  }
```

## `source-map-support`

Source map support is now a responsibility of the app server. If you are using `remix-serve`, nothing is required. If you are using your own app server, you will need to install [`source-map-support`][source-map-support] yourself.

```shellscript nonumber
npm i source-map-support
```

```ts filename=server.ts
import sourceMapSupport from "source-map-support";

sourceMapSupport.install();
```

`source-map-support` introduces incompatibilities with certain observability tools, causing the tool not to be able to properly unminify your errors.
If you want to opt out of using `source-map-support` when using `remix-serve`, you can set `REMIX_NO_SOURCE_MAP_SUPPORT=1` as environment variable.

## Netlify adapter

The `@remix-run/netlify` runtime adapter has been deprecated in favor of
[`@netlify/remix-adapter`][official-netlify-adapter] & [`@netlify/remix-edge-adapter`][official-netlify-edge-adapter]
and is now removed as of Remix v2. Please update your code by changing all `@remix-run/netlify` imports to
`@netlify/remix-adapter`.\
Keep in mind that `@netlify/remix-adapter` requires `@netlify/functions@^1.0.0`, which is a breaking change compared
to the current supported `@netlify/functions` versions in `@remix-run/netlify`.

Due to the removal of this adapter, we also removed our [Netlify template][netlify-template] in favor of the
[official Netlify template][official-netlify-template].

## Vercel adapter

The `@remix-run/vercel` runtime adapter has been deprecated in favor of out of the box Vercel functionality and is now
removed as of Remix v2. Please update your code by removing `@remix-run/vercel` & `@vercel/node` from your
`package.json`, removing your `server.js`/`server.ts` file, and removing the `server` & `serverBuildPath` options
from your `remix.config.js`.

Due to the removal of this adapter, we also removed our [Vercel template][vercel-template] in favor of the
[official Vercel template][official-vercel-template].

## Built-in PostCSS/Tailwind support

In v2, these tools are automatically used within the Remix compiler if PostCSS and/or Tailwind configuration files are present in your project.

If you have a custom PostCSS and/or Tailwind setup outside of Remix that you'd like to maintain when migrating to v2, you can disable these features in your `remix.config.js`.

```js filename=remix.config.js
/** @type {import('@remix-run/dev').AppConfig} */
module.exports = {
  postcss: false,
  tailwind: false,
};
```

## Troubleshooting

### ESM / CommonJS Errors

```sh
"SyntaxError: Named export '<something>' not found. The requested module '<something>' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports."
```

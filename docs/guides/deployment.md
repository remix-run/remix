# Deployment

Remix maintains a few [starter templates][starter-templates] to help you deploy to various servers right from the start. You should be able to initialize your app and get it live within a couple of minutes.

Running `npx create-remix@latest` with the `--template` flag allows you to provide the URL to one of these templates, for example:

```sh
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/express
```

Each target has unique file structures, configuration files, cli commands that need to be run, server environment variables to be set, etc. Because of this, it's important to read the README.md to deploy the app. It's got all the steps you need to take to get your app live within minutes.

Additionally, Remix doesn't abstract over your infrastructure, so the templates don't hide anything about where you're deploying to (you may want other functions besides the Remix app!). You're welcome to tweak the configuration to suit your needs. Remix runs on your server, but it is not your server.

In a nutshell: if you want to deploy your app, Read the manual ðŸ˜‹

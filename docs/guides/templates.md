# Templates and Stacks

<docs-warning>Just getting started with Remix? The latest version of [Remix is now React Router v7][remix-now-react-router]. If you want to use the latest framework features, you should create your project using a [React Router template][react-router-templates].</docs-warning>

When using [`create-remix`][create_remix] to generate a new project, you can choose a Template or a Stack to quickly get up and running. Templates are minimal starting points to get you up and running. "Stacks" are templates that are more-complete and closer to production ready architectures (potentially including aspects such as testing, database, CI, and deployment configurations).

## Templates

If you run `create-remix` without providing the `--template` option, you'll get a basic template using the [Remix App Server][remix_app_server].

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest
```

If you are not interested in using TypeScript, you can install the simpler Javascript template instead:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/remix-javascript
```

This is a great place to start if you're just looking to try out Remix for the first time. You can always extend this starting point yourself or migrate to a more advanced template later.

### Official Templates

If you want more control over your server or wish to deploy to a non-node runtimeâ€”such as [Arc][arc], [Cloudflare][cloudflare], or [Deno][deno]â€”then you can try one of our [official templates][official_templates] from the Remix repository:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/cloudflare
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/cloudflare-workers
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/express
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/remix
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/remix-javascript

## SPA Mode
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/spa

## Classic Remix Compiler
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/arc
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/cloudflare-pages
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/cloudflare-workers
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/deno
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/express
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/fly
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/remix
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/remix/templates/classic-remix-compiler/remix-javascript
```

### Third-Party Templates

Some hosting providers maintain their own Remix templates. For more information, see their official integration guides listed below.

- [Netlify][netlify_template_docs]
- [Vercel][vercel_template_docs]

### Examples

We also provide a [community-driven examples repository][examples], with each example showcasing different Remix features, patterns, tools, hosting providers, etc. You can use these in a similar manner to install the working example:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/examples/basic
```

## Stacks

When a template is closer to being a production-ready application, to the point that it provides opinions about the CI/CD pipeline, database and hosting platform, the Remix community refers to these templates as "stacks".

There are several official stacks provided, but you can also make your own (read more below).

[Read the feature announcement blog post][feature_announcement_blog_post] and [watch Remix Stacks videos on YouTube][remix_stacks_videos_on_youtube].

### Official Stacks

The official stacks come ready with common things you need for a production application including:

- Database
- Automatic deployment pipelines
- Authentication
- Testing
- Linting/Formatting/TypeScript

What you're left with is everything completely set up for you to just get to work building whatever amazing web experience you want to build with Remix. Here are the official stacks:

- [The Blues Stack][blues_stack]: Deployed to the edge (distributed) with a long-running Node.js server and PostgreSQL database. Intended for large and fast production-grade applications serving millions of users.
- [The Indie Stack][indie_stack]: Deployed to a long-running Node.js server with a persistent SQLite database. This stack is great for websites with dynamic data that you control (blogs, marketing, content sites). It's also a perfect, low-complexity bootstrap for MVPs, prototypes, and proof-of-concepts that can later be updated to the Blues stack easily.
- [The Grunge Stack][grunge_stack]: Deployed to a serverless function running Node.js with DynamoDB for persistence. Intended for folks who want to deploy a production-grade application on AWS infrastructure serving millions of users.

You can use these stacks by providing the `--template` option when running `create-remix`, for example:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template remix-run/blues-stack
```

Yes, these are named after music genres. ðŸ¤˜ Rock on.

### Community Stacks

You can [browse the list of community stacks on GitHub][remix_stack_topic].

Community stacks can be used by passing the GitHub username/repo combo to the `--template` option when running `create-remix`, for example:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template :username/:repo
```

<docs-success>If you want to share your stack with the community, don't forget to tag it with the [remix-stack][remix_stack_topic] topic so others can find it â€” and yes, we do recommend that you name your own stack after a music sub-genre (not "rock" but "indie"!).</docs-success>

## Other Information

### Private Templates

If your template is in a private GitHub repo, you can pass a GitHub token via the `--token` option:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template your-private/repo --token yourtoken
```

The [token just needs `repo` access][repo_access_token].

### Local Templates

You can provide a local directory or tarball on disk to the `--template` option, for example:

```shellscript nonumber
npx create-remix@latest --template /my/remix-stack
npx create-remix@latest --template /my/remix-stack.tar.gz
npx create-remix@latest --template /my/remix-stack.tgz
npx create-remix@latest --template file:///Users/michael/my-remix-stack.tar.gz
```

### Custom Template Tips

#### Dependency Versions

If you set any dependencies in package.json to `*`, the Remix CLI will change it to a semver caret of the installed Remix version:

```diff
-   "remix": "*",
+   "remix": "^2.0.0",
```

This allows you to not have to regularly update your template to the latest version of that specific package. Of course, you do not have to put `*` if you'd prefer to manually manage the version for that package.

#### Customize Initialization

If the template has a `remix.init/index.js` file at the root then that file will be executed after the project has been generated and dependencies have been installed. This gives you a chance to do anything you'd like as part of the initialization of your template. For example, in the blues stack, the `app` property has to be globally unique, so we use the `remix.init/index.js` file to change it to the name of the directory that was created for the project + a couple random characters.

You could even use `remix.init/index.js` to ask further questions to the developer for additional configuration (using something like [inquirer][inquirer]). Sometimes, you'll need dependencies installed to do this, but those deps are only useful during initialization. In that case, you can also create a `remix.init/package.json` with dependencies and the Remix CLI will install those before running your script.

After the init script has been run, the `remix.init` folder gets deleted, so you don't need to worry about it cluttering up the finished codebase.

<docs-warning>Do note that consumers can opt out of running the `remix.init` script. To do so manually, they'll need to run `remix init`.</docs-warning>

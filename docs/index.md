# Remix Docs

Holy smokes you're here! Let's do this. Welcome to the v1 stable release of Remix! Just so we're all clear, this is newly open sourced, so stable means "the API is stable", it doesnâ€™t mean we don't have any bugs ðŸ˜… (though, we think we're doing alright). Let us know if you think you found one on [GitHub][git-hub].

## Getting Started

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

We **strongly encourage you** to do one of the tutorials before anything else. Remix is different. The tutorials will show you how to start with web fundamentals and then progressively enhance your app to the modern UX you're after.

  <a href="v1/tutorials/blog" aria-label="Developer Blog Tutorial">
    <docs-card>
      <h4>Quickstart</h4>
      <p>Spend your first few minutes with Remix here and let us introduce some of the core features as quickly as possible. After this you can go explore the docs or dive deeper with the other tutorials. We'll build a little markdown blog with data loading, actions, form validation, redirects, and more.</p>

  <a href="v1/tutorials/jokes" aria-label="Jokes App Tutorial">
    <docs-card>
      <h4>Jokes App Deep Dive</h4> 
      <p>Dive deep into Remix and full stack development with this app. It's backed by a SQL database, user authentication and session, and of course some modern UI finishes. You'll learn about nested routes, sessions, data loading, data mutations, progressive enhancement, and more. Get a feel for what a data-backed web app feels like with Remix.</p>

  <a href="v1/api/conventions" aria-label="Conventional APIs">
    <docs-card>
      <h4>Conventional APIs</h4> 
      <p>Remix has a handful of conventions to make web application development a breeze. You'll spend some time in this document when you're first learning Remix, but probably won't need it much after you get your feet wet.</p>

    <docs-card>
      <h4>Remix Package API</h4>
      <p>This is probably the doc page you'll visit the most. It's got all of the Remix package exports that you'll use day-to-day in your app.</p>

# React Router v6

Remix is built on top of React Router v6. Here are the most common APIs that you'll use in your Remix app:

- [`Outlet`][reactrouter-1]
- [`useLocation`][reactrouter-2]
- [`useNavigate`][reactrouter-3]
- [`useParams`][reactrouter-4]
- [`useResolvedPath`][reactrouter-5]

Most of the other APIs are either used internally by Remix or just aren't commonly needed in your app.

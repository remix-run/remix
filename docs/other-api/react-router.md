# React Router v6

Remix is built on top of React Router v6. Here are the most common APIs that you'll use in your Remix app:

- [`Outlet`][outlet]
- [`useLocation`][use-location]
- [`useNavigate`][use-navigate]
- [`useParams`][use-params]
- [`useResolvedPath`][use-resolved-path]

Most of the other APIs are either used internally by Remix or just aren't commonly needed in your app.

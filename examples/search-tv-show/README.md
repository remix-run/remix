# Welcome to Remix!

This is a very basic example of a simple Remix app using the Remix App Server.

- [Remix Docs](https://remix.run/docs)

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

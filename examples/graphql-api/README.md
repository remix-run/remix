# GraphQL API

This example demonstrates using the Fetch API to query a GraphQL endpoint. It also makes use of a [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) which introspects the GraphQL API in order to generate types that can be used in our `useLoaderData` hooks for strong, generated types.

## Setup

- Duplicate the local `.env.example` file to `.env`
- Run `$ npm install`

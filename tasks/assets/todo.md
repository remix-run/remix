# Assets Middleware - TODO

NOTE: Tasks that are in progress should be moved to `in-progress.md`.

## Features

### Canonical URL redirects for `/__@workspace/`

Ensure one URL per physical file by redirecting `/__@workspace/` requests to simpler URLs when the file's realpath is inside the project root.

**The problem:**

For example, if you're in a workspace package (`packages/web-app/`) with workspace root set to the monorepo root, someone could request `/__@workspace/packages/web-app/utils/helper.js` - but that file is inside the project root, so it should be served at `/utils/helper.js` instead. Serving both URLs for the same file can cause duplicate module instances.

**The solution:**

- Canonical URL is determined by where the file's **realpath** lives
- Realpath inside project root → canonical is `/path/in/project` (no `/__@workspace/`)
- Realpath outside project root → canonical is `/__@workspace/path/from/workspace-root`
- When serving `/__@workspace/` requests, check if realpath is in project root → redirect to canonical URL

**Benefits:**

- Simple projects with local `node_modules` don't need `workspace` config at all
- Monorepos with symlinked workspace packages correctly use `/__@workspace/` (symlink realpath is outside project)
- No duplicate module instances regardless of how files are accessed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `/__@workspace/` requests redirect to `/...` URL when file's realpath is inside project root
- [ ] Symlinked files that resolve outside project root stay at `/__@workspace/` URLs (no redirect)
- [ ] Import rewriting generates canonical URLs (already works, just verify)
- [ ] Unit tests for redirect logic with symlink vs non-symlink cases
- [ ] Demo works without `workspace` config when run in a standalone (non-monorepo) setup

### Improve ETag cache invalidation

**The problem:**

ETags are currently based on source file mtime/size. But the transformed output depends on more than just the source:

- Middleware transform logic (esbuild config, import rewriting rules)
- esbuild version
- Other dependencies

If transform logic changes but source files don't, the browser can serve stale cached transforms with outdated import paths (e.g., old URL patterns after renaming).

**Ideas to explore:**

- **Lockfile** - Changes when deps update. Could use mtime or content hash.
- **Middleware package (monorepo only)** - Auto-detect if we're in the Remix monorepo and factor in changes to `packages/dev-assets-middleware/`. This handles active middleware development.

Note: Directory mtime behavior varies by OS (may only update on add/remove, not content changes). May need to hash file list + mtimes, or find most recent file mtime recursively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] ETag invalidates when project dependencies change
- [ ] ETag invalidates when middleware package changes (when developing in monorepo)
- [ ] Solution is computed once at init, not per-request
- [ ] Unit tests for ETag generation with different scenarios

### Pre-emptive import transforms (eliminate waterfalls)

**Dependencies:** Module graph task (above)

When transforming a file, proactively transform its immediate imports in the background. This eliminates request waterfalls where the browser must wait for each level of imports sequentially.

**Current behavior (waterfall):**

```
Browser requests /entry.tsx
  → Server transforms (200ms)
  → Browser parses, sees import './utils.ts'
    → Browser requests /utils.ts
      → Server transforms (50ms)
```

**With pre-emptive transforms:**

```
Browser requests /entry.tsx
  → Server transforms entry.tsx
  → Kicks off background transform for ./utils.ts
  → Returns entry.tsx (200ms)
Browser requests /utils.ts
  → Already in cache ✨
  → Instant response
```

**Strategy:**

1. **One level deep only** - Only transform immediate static imports, not transitive
2. **Don't block response** - Kick off background transforms, return immediately
3. **Natural cascade** - Each transform warms its own imports, creates chain reaction
4. **Error handling** - Log errors but don't throw (let browser see error when it requests)

**Why one level?**

- Avoids server spinning on deep import trees
- Most benefit for least work (first hop is most expensive)
- Predictable resource usage

**Error handling:**

```typescript
async warmupRequest(url: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    await transformRequest(url)
  } catch (error) {
    // Log but don't throw - let browser see real error on request
    logger.warn(`Pre-transform error for ${url}: ${error.message}`)
  }
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] After transforming a file, extract static imports
- [ ] Kick off background transforms for immediate imports only (one level)
- [ ] Don't wait for background transforms to complete before returning response
- [ ] Log pre-transform errors but don't throw
- [ ] Performance metrics show reduced waterfall depth
- [ ] Works with module graph caching (doesn't re-transform unnecessarily)

### `basePath` option for static-middleware

**Package:** `@remix-run/static-middleware`

Add a `basePath` option to mount static files at a URL prefix, similar to Express's `app.use('/path', express.static(...))` pattern.

```ts
// Current workaround (serves from project root with filter)
staticFiles('.', { filter: (path) => path.startsWith('build/') })

// Desired API
staticFiles('./build', { basePath: '/build' })
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] `basePath` option strips the prefix before looking up files
- [ ] Request to `/build/entry.js` with `basePath: '/build'` serves `./build/entry.js`
- [ ] Requests not matching the basePath fall through to next middleware
- [ ] Works with other options (filter, index, listFiles, etc.)
- [ ] Unit tests for basePath matching and stripping
- [ ] Add change file for the new feature

---

## Testing

**Notes:**

- Future tasks should include tests as part of their acceptance criteria.
- Any new URL patterns must use browser-friendly URLs in source maps (not filesystem paths). Use `parseInlineSourceMap()` in unit tests to verify.

---

## Out of Scope (For Now)

These are explicitly not part of the initial spike:

- **CSS imports** - Use CSS-in-JS or manual `<link>` tags
- **CSS chunk tracking** - Not tracked in manifest, even in prod
- **Pre-bundling** - Future optimization for CJS packages or large dep trees
- **Multiple root directories** - Single root for now

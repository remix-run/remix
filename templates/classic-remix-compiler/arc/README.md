## Development

The following command will run two processes during development when using Architect as your server.

- Your Architect server sandbox
- The Remix development server

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

Your file changes are watched, and assets are rebuilt upon change.

Open up [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) and you should be ready to go!

## Deploying

Before you can deploy, you'll need to do some setup with AWS:

- First [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- Then [follow the Architect setup instructions](https://arc.codes/docs/en/guides/get-started/detailed-aws-setup).

If you make it through all of that, you're ready to deploy!

1. build the app for production:

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy with `arc`

   ```sh
   npx arc deploy production
   ```

You're in business!

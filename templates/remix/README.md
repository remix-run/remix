# Remix template ESLint example

This directory contains an example `.eslintrc.cjs` file used by the Remix templates.
It provides a starting point for ESLint configuration for both JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

If you use `create-remix` to generate a new project and need an ESLint config, copy `.eslintrc.cjs`
from this folder into your project root and adjust the `overrides` and `parserOptions.project` as needed.
